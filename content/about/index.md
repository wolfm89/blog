I'm Wolfgang, a Solutions Architect based in Munich with 7+ years of experience in Cloud, Infrastructure, Data Engineering, Software Development, DevOps, and MLOps.
I work at an IT consulting firm that specializes in Cloud, Data, and AI, and I'm passionate about crafting solutions that bridge innovation with practical impact.

This blog should act as a digital notebook—a place where I jot down insights, reflections, and technical notes from my work and personal projects.
It's a way to capture knowledge, clarify thoughts, and share discoveries. I’ve always believed that learning and building shouldn't happen in isolation,
so I’ve made these notes publicly accessible for anyone who might find them helpful or thought-provoking.

Beyond the professional sphere, I’m an avid hiker and outdoor table tennis player who's interested in philosophy (especially ethics and epistemology),

Feel free to explore, learn, and connect. I hope these entries spark curiosity or serve as a helpful resource in your own journey.
